## Entity Framework vs Dapper
two versions are implemented for fetching.
* EF Core may not be as fast as Dapper for complex queries, especially when dealing with large datasets. This is due to the overhead of tracking entities, generating SQL dynamically, and handling lazy loading.
* Dapper is generally faster than EF Core for read-heavy operations
